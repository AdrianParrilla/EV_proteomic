# EV_proteomic
Proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from blood plasma of old and young cohorts. From all detected proteins, we extract the mitochondrial proteins and surface markers to assess differences in cargo between EVs and infer their possible origin. Samples were TMT-labelled and pre-processed by the EMBL core facility.
