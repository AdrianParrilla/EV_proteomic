# EV_proteomic
Proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from old and young cohorts. From all the proteins detected we extract the mitochondrial proteins and surface markers to asses diferences in cargo between EVs and to infere their possible origin. Samples are TMT labelled and preprocess by EMBL core facility.
